## Features

üõ°Ô∏è **Universal Privacy Protection**

- **Cleans All URLs**: Removes common tracking parameters from _any_ URL, not just those from specific providers.
- **Removes Tracking Pixels**: Strips 1x1 pixels and other tracking images from email content.
- **Powered by ClearURLs**: Uses the excellent [ClearURLs](https://gitlab.com/ClearURLs/Rules) ruleset for provider-specific cleaning.

üöÄ **High Performance & Modern**

- **Streaming Architecture**: Built for modern edge environments like Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions, and Deno.
- **Buffered API**: Provides a simple, memory-based API for traditional Node.js environments.
- **Efficient**: Uses `linkedom` for fast, server-side DOM parsing in buffered mode.

üîß **Customizable & Flexible**

- Configure or extend the tracking domains and parameters.
- Choose between streaming handlers or a simple buffered function.
- Preserve the full HTML structure or extract only the `<body>` content.

## How It Works

The library takes HTML content and sanitizes it in two main ways:

### 1. URL Cleaning

A two-pass system ensures comprehensive cleaning:

1.  **Default Cleaning**: A built-in list of common tracking parameters (e.g., `utm_source`, `fbclid`, `gclid`) is removed from **every URL**.
2.  **Provider-Specific Cleaning**: For domains found in the ClearURLs ruleset (like Google, Facebook, Amazon), a second, more specific set of rules is applied.

### 2. Tracking Pixel Detection

The library removes `<img>` tags that are likely to be tracking pixels by checking for:

- **1x1 or 2x2 dimensions**.
- **Known tracking domains** (e.g., `google-analytics.com`).
- **Hidden styles** (`display: none`, `visibility: hidden`).
- **Lack of descriptive `alt` text**.

## Installation

```bash
npm install email-scrubber-core
```

## Quick Start

### For Node.js (Buffered API)

This is the simplest way to use the library in a standard Node.js application.

```typescript
import { sanitizeEmailBuffered, createMinimalRules } from 'email-scrubber-core';

// Use the built-in minimal ruleset, which includes default cleaning.
const rules = createMinimalRules();

const dirtyEmail = `
  <div>
    <p>Check out our <a href="https://a-random-site.com/product?utm_source=email">latest product</a>!</p>
    <img src="https://google-analytics.com/collect?tid=UA-12345" width="1" height="1">
  </div>
`;

// sanitizeEmailBuffered processes the entire HTML string in memory.
const result = sanitizeEmailBuffered(dirtyEmail, rules);

// Resulting HTML:
// <div>
//   <p>Check out our <a href="https://a-random-site.com/product">latest product</a>!</p>
// </div>
console.log(result.html);

console.log(
  `Cleaned ${result.urlsCleaned} URLs and removed ${result.trackingPixelsRemoved} tracking pixels.`
);
```

### For Cloudflare Workers (Streaming API)

This is the recommended, high-performance approach for edge environments. It transforms the HTML _as it streams_ without buffering the entire body in memory.

```typescript
// In your Cloudflare Worker's main file:
import { getStreamingHandlers, createMinimalRules } from 'email-scrubber-core';

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    // Fetch the original response from your origin.
    const response = await fetch(request);

    // Get the sanitization rules and handlers.
    const rules = createMinimalRules();
    const handlers = getStreamingHandlers(rules);

    // Create an HTMLRewriter and attach the handlers.
    const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter()
      .on('a[href]', handlers.linkHandler)
      .on('img', handlers.pixelHandler);

    // Return the transformed response.
    return rewriter.transform(response);
  },
};
```

## API Reference

### Core Functions

#### `sanitizeEmailBuffered(html, rules, options?)`

Sanitizes a complete HTML string in memory. Ideal for Node.js.

- **`html`** (string): The HTML content to sanitize.
- **`rules`** (ClearUrlRules): The ruleset to apply.
- **`options`** (SanitizeEmailOptions): Optional configuration.
- **Returns**: `SanitizeEmailResult`

#### `getStreamingHandlers(rules)`

Returns handler objects for use with `HTMLRewriter` in a streaming environment.

- **`rules`** (ClearUrlRules): The ruleset to apply.
- **Returns**: An object with `linkHandler` and `pixelHandler`.

#### `createMinimalRules()`

Returns a built-in, lightweight ruleset that includes the default `*` rule for cleaning all URLs, plus specific rules for major providers like Google and Facebook. **This is often all you need.**
